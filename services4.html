            Sounds familiar? Computers become slow during the time. Corrupt old and redundant files quickly build up in the computer.

          <p>
            This causes computer to be slow, sluggish and causes crashes, system errors and serious slowdowns when you need your PC the most. 
            It is the biggest annoyance when you need to wait for computer to go through the simple task. 
            Often this happens to older PC’s but this can happen to new computers too.
