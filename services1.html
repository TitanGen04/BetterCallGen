          <h1>Computer Won’t Turn On</h1>
          <p>
            Most scariest thing that can happen to your MAC or Windows computer is failure to turn on at all. 
            You press the little power button and nothing happens. No beeps, clicks, clunks or whirs. Light on the 
            monitor is on, but your computer is totally dead.  First of all don’t panic! When people face that kind
            of problem, they are tend to panic, worried that all important data on their PC or MAC are gone. 
            Most probably your documents and pictures are safe, just not accessible at the moment. 
            This computer problem shows that one of the hardware components have failed..
